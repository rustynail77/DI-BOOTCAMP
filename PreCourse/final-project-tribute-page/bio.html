            <span style="font-size:3em">H</span>omer Jay Simpson is the bumbling husband of Marge, 
            and father to Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson.
            He is the son of Mona and Abraham "Grampa" Simpson. 
            Homer held over 188 different jobs in the first 400 episodes of The Simpsons.
            In most episodes, he works as the nuclear safety inspector at the 
            Springfield Nuclear Power Plant (in Sector 7-G), a position which he has held 
            since "Homer's Odyssey", the third episode of the series, despite the fact that 
            he is totally unsuitable for it. At the nuclear plant, Homer is often ignored 
            and completely forgotten by his boss Mr. Burns, and he constantly falls asleep 
            and neglects his duties. Matt Groening has stated that he decided to have 
            Homer work at the power plant because of the potential for Homer to wreak severe 
            havoc. Each of his other jobs has lasted only one episode. In the first half of 
            the series, the writers developed an explanation about how he got fired from 
            the plant and was then rehired in every episode. 
            In later episodes, he often began a new job on impulse, without any mention 
            of his regular employment.
